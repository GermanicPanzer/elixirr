## Hello!
This is not made by me. This just exists for an easier tutorial.<br> 
If you want to go to the original, click here: https://github.com/whos-evan/elixir<br>
Anyways, here are the steps:<br>
1. Click on the "Remix on Glitch" button.
2. Wait.
3. Click on the 3 dots in the top right above the preview and click on "Open in new window".
4. The link that you see is now the website. Congrats, you did it!<br>

Sadly, you can't change the link unless you buy something. It's randomly generated, so I suggest bookmarking it or something.<br><br>
